# Netchill

The project is the somewhat (around 60%) replica of NETFLIX. It comprises of 6 html pages and their corresponding css files. The main idea was to create a small-scale website for fun. Mainpage.html has around 55 movie/series links, which on clicking, takes you to a html page(video.html) with youtube embedded links. You can search your favourite movie(from provide 55) using search bar provided (avoid pressing enter key and use "tab" instead)
